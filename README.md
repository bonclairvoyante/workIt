# work-it-landing-page
This project was built using Bootstrap with some css for custom components like buttons and background images. 
I encountered difficulties bulding the rounded hero and middled backgrounds but found a way aroun it by creating the rounded bottoms, taking a screenshot and using it as an svg. However, I doubt if this is the most optimal way to do it.
I also encountered a challenge in positioning the hero image. Figured it out with media queries. 
I learned how to write media queries and use bootstrap.
